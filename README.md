# Arduino Library for SNES Controller

SNES controllers are a great, easy input for any arduino project. Dont worry about fussing with resistors and tiny finger destroying, breadboard buttons. This is a simple library to talk to a standard SNES controller.

Here is the basic pinout of a SNES controller:

```
  SNES Connector Layout (SNS-005)
  ---
  |0| - 5V - White Wire
  |0| - CLOCK - Yellow Wire
  |0| - LATCH - Orange Wire
  |0| - DATA - Red Wire
  ---
  |0| - X
  |0| - X
  |0| - GND - Brown Wire
  ---
```

[Bitluni](http://bitluni.net/gamepad) has a great write up about how the controller protocol works and a short video of how to splice the controller cable.
